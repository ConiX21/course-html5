How Did HTML5 Get Started?

HTML5 is a cooperation between the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG).

WHATWG was working with web forms and applications, and W3C was working with XHTML 2.0. In 2006, they decided to cooperate and create a new version of HTML.

Some rules for HTML5 were established:
•New features should be based on HTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript
•Reduce the need for external plugins (like Flash)
•Better error handling
•More markup to replace scripting
•HTML5 should be device independent
•The development process should be visible to the public
